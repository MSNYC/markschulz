# About Me

I'm a pharmaceutical marketing and advertising professional with 20+ years of experience spanning three major industry perspectives: **Creative Agency**, **Manufacturer**, and **Publisher**. This unique combination allows me to approach challenges with a comprehensive understanding of the entire pharmaceutical marketing ecosystem.

## Professional Background

My career has been defined by bridging creativity with technology, and strategy with execution. I've worked across the full spectrum of pharmaceutical marketing—from HCP strategy and positioning to patient engagement, from AI/ML integration to omnichannel experience design. Whether developing brand strategies for oncology therapeutics or pioneering AI adoption across organizations, I focus on delivering measurable impact through innovation and collaboration.

## About My Approach

### Intro

I've been fortunate to work in organizations like Pfizer that take professional development seriously. Through that experience, I've had access to tools such as the Myers-Briggs (ENTJ) and FIRO-B assessments, which offer structured insight into how I think, collaborate, and lead. This section distills those findings into a clear, practical view of my approach to work.

### My Assessment Snapshot

As a Myers-Briggs **ENTJ**, I'm wired for strategic thinking, structured problem-solving, and decisive action—traits that shape how I bring order to ambiguity and help teams move forward with clarity and purpose.

My FIRO-B profile highlights **Inclusion** as my strongest interpersonal driver. I tend to lead by engaging people, creating alignment, and ensuring teams understand how their work connects to the overarching mission. With lower Control needs and moderate Affection needs, I collaborate by empowering others, emphasizing clarity and fairness, and avoiding unnecessary micromanagement.

These results provide a concise, evidence-based understanding of why my professional style is consistently strategic, inclusive, objective, and geared toward building high-performing environments.

### Thinking Strategically, Delivering Clarity

I quickly make sense of complex environments and translate insights into actionable direction. I'm energized by big challenges, cross-functional problem-solving, and work that blends analytical rigor with creativity. My focus is always on helping teams move with intention and know exactly where we're headed.

### Creating Alignment Through Inclusion

Progress accelerates when people feel connected to the mission. I bring teams together early, clarify expectations, and ensure information flows smoothly across functions. I aim to create an environment where people feel informed, valued, and aligned—not just involved.

### Leading With Objectivity and Fairness

I approach decisions with structure, logic, and a wide-angle view of implications. I value competence, integrity, and transparency, and I hold myself to those same standards. My priority is reducing ambiguity so teams can focus their energy where it matters most.

### Driving Momentum While Remaining Adaptable

I'm comfortable setting direction and making the tough calls, but equally willing to reassess assumptions and pivot when new information emerges. My leadership is action-oriented, ideas-driven, and aimed at building systems that support sustained performance.

### Human-Centered, Even When Focused on the Big Picture

While I naturally orient toward logic and efficiency, I'm intentional about how decisions and change affect people. I work to create an environment of openness, recognition, and constructive dialogue—where individuals feel they're part of the journey, not just informed about it.
