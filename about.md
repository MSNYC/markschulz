# About Me

I'm a pharmaceutical marketing and advertising professional with 20+ years of experience spanning three major industry perspectives: **Creative Agency**, **Manufacturer**, and **Publisher**. This unique combination allows me to approach challenges with a comprehensive understanding of the entire pharmaceutical marketing ecosystem.

## Professional Background

My career has been defined by bridging creativity with technology, and strategy with execution. I've worked across the full spectrum of pharmaceutical marketing—from HCP strategy and positioning to patient engagement, from AI/ML integration to omnichannel experience design. Whether developing brand strategies for oncology therapeutics or pioneering AI adoption across organizations, I focus on delivering measurable impact through innovation and collaboration.

## My Approach

I believe the future of pharmaceutical marketing lies at the intersection of human insight and technological capability. That's why I've dedicated significant effort to democratizing AI/ML tools, building custom GPTs, and creating data pipelines that turn complex information into actionable intelligence. My goal is always to make sophisticated capabilities accessible and practical for the teams I work with.
