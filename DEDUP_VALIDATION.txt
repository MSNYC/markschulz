SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING VALIDATION
================================================================================

The deduplication correctly understood:

✓ Position Context
  - Podcast was VIAGRA work (not LIPITOR)
  - Group Practice Adherence was LIPITOR work (not VIAGRA)
  - AllScripts was LIPITOR Marketing Manager work
  - Tablet PC eDetailing was VIAGRA work

✓ Seniority Appropriateness
  - VP-level achievements consolidated at VP positions
  - Director-level achievements kept at Director level
  - Admin Assistant achievements correctly scoped

✓ Chronological Accuracy
  - Podcast timeline: May 2007 - April 2008 (specific dates kept)
  - PDUFA launch: 24 hours (corrected from inflated 48 hours)

✓ Metric Specificity
  - Budget: $4.5M with HCP marketing specifics
  - SOWs: ~5 per year at $1M+ each
  - Team size: 5 direct reports (specific number kept)

================================================================================
CONSERVATIVE APPROACH VERIFICATION
================================================================================

The script was appropriately conservative:

✓ Did NOT remove achievements that were:
  - Similar but in different domains (multiple AI projects kept)
  - Same type of work at different companies
  - Progressive responsibility (junior vs senior versions of similar work)

✓ Only removed TRUE duplicates:
  - Same underlying work with different wording
  - Same achievement in wrong position
  - Less detailed versions of same achievement

✓ When uncertain, kept both:
  - Multiple data engineering achievements (different projects)
  - Multiple analytics achievements (different analyses)
  - Multiple AI/GPT achievements (different tools/purposes)

================================================================================
FINAL STATUS
================================================================================
