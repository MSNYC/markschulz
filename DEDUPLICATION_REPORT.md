2. **Update resume.json meta section** - Consider incrementing version to reflect this major cleanup
3. **Regenerate markdown resume** - Run `python3 scripts/generate_resume_markdown.py` to create updated outputs
4. **Test resume builder** - Verify that the interactive resume (`resume-interactive.html`) works correctly with the cleaned data
