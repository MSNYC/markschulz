SEMANTIC ANALYSIS:
------------------
✓ Analyzed all 175 achievements for semantic meaning
✓ Identified 14 groups of TRUE duplicates
✓ Used context clues: brand names, job titles, dates, seniority
✓ Distinguished same work from similar work
✓ Corrected position attribution errors

DUPLICATES REMOVED:
-------------------
1. Podcast (5 → 1): Kept VIAGRA version with specific dates
2. Group Practice Adherence (4 → 1): Kept LIPITOR detailed version
3. AllScripts EMR (4 → 1): Kept LIPITOR Marketing Manager version
4. Tablet PC eDetailing (6 → 1): Kept VIAGRA "Digital Captain" version
5. PM Team Leadership (3 → 1): Consolidated at VP level
6. Multi-departmental Resourcing (3 → 1): Consolidated at VP level

10. SOW Formulation (2 → 1): Consolidated at VP level
11. SOW Drafting $1M+ (2 → 1): Consolidated at VP level
12. Interagency Consolidation (2 → 1): Kept most detailed
13. WebMD Strategic Oversight (2 → 1): Kept Sr. Dir with IQVIA details
14. WebMD Data Sources (2 → 1): Kept version with specific sources

CONSERVATIVE APPROACH:

✓ Kept all unique analytics work (different datasets)
✓ Kept all unique CRM initiatives (different programs)
✓ When uncertain, kept both achievements
