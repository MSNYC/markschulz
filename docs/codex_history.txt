Project: Web Reporting pipeline for Google Analytics (GA4) data.
Goal: Build a reusable flow to extract GA data, clean/transform it, run analyses (stats/trends/anomalies/viz), and populate reporting templates.
Key tasks/decisions: Restructured the repo into modular pipeline areas (extract/transform/analyze/reporting) and set up supporting folders for configs, scripts, notebooks, docs, templates, tests; aligned data and credentials into dedicated directories; ensured package-style imports via __init__.py.
Outcomes: Source files moved under src/web_reporting/ (extract and analyze modules), data files placed in data/raw and data/processed, credentials moved to credentials/, scaffolding files (.gitkeep) added across empty dirs, .gitignore created to exclude secrets, data, and env artifacts.
Skills/tools: Repo organization, Python packaging layout, data/credential hygiene, Git-friendly ignore rules.
Open issues/next steps: Initialize git and add remote; update imports to match new package layout; add config-driven GA parameters in configs/; create CLI or script in scripts/ to run end-to-end; flesh out transform/reporting modules and tests.

Project: Biolumina Web Reporting.
Goal: Re-establish repo hygiene after moving project (restore ignores, prep for Git init).
Key tasks/decisions: Verified no .git present; created a new .gitignore tailored for Python/data and credentials; clarified Git init/add workflow and the git commit -m flag.
Outcomes: Added .gitignore covering OS cruft, caches, build artifacts, virtualenvs, notebooks, data outputs, and credentials (keeps .gitkeep placeholders). Provided step-by-step commands to git init, stage, and commit.
Tools/skills: Git CLI basics, Python project ignore conventions, command-line inspection.
Open issues/next steps: Remove any stray .DS_Store if desired, then git init, git add ., and commit; ensure sensitive files stay out via the new ignore rules.

Project: WebReporting analytics migration (brand-agnostic DuckDB pipeline).
Goal: Replace legacy one-off Excel scripts with reusable DuckDB-driven analyses; produce timestamped outputs and PPT-ready insights/visuals.
Decisions/Tasks: Ported traffic, downloads, sources, engagement, device, and contact-a-rep analyses into src/analysis with shared db/utils; standardized CLIs (audience selection where applicable, event overlays for traffic/engagement), and new output folder naming YYYY_MM_DD__HH_MM_SS__<analysis>/<analysis>/. Replaced contact trend chart with trailing-4Q stacked bar by profession. Chart titles now include quarter date ranges; number formatting improved.
Deliverables: Updated Python modules (traffic.py, downloads.py, source.py, engagement.py, device.py, contact.py); shared db.py/utils.py; outputs now timestamped; insights text generation per analysis; docs updated (README with CLI usage, docs/reporting_analysis_migration.md plan); issue log updated/closed for completed ports.
Tools/Skills: DuckDB SQL, pandas transformations, matplotlib/seaborn plotting (including event overlays), CLI design, repo/docs hygiene, .gitignore setup.
Open/Next: Automate PPT/report assembly (issue 25-10-16), validation tasks for header mapping/post-load reconciliation (25-10-12/13), consider remaining legacy analyses (e.g., page rank, paid impression correlation).

Project: Multi-Brand WebReporting Environment & Loader Stabilization
Goal: Enable multiple brands to use a single analytics codebase by isolating data/config/output per brand; harden all ETL loaders against vendor header drift and inconsistent Excel schemas.

Decisions/Tasks: Introduced brand-scoped workspaces (brands/<brand>/) with .env path routing (ANALYTICS_*). Updated all loaders (traffic, downloads, pages, devices, sources) to use central path helpers and expanded header handling (forward-fill audiences, drop metadata, coerce date formats). Built TEVIMBRA workspace via bootstrap script, corrected brand YAML configs, and fixed recurring loader failures (traffic header detection, downloads unmapped columns, pages metadata stripping). Added query_duckdb.py for warehouse validation and reconciled misaligned data across Brukinsa/myBeOne brands.

Deliverables: Updated Python modules across src/warehouse/; brand-specific column YAMLs for Brukinsa and TEVIMBRA; expanded date/audience mapping logic; improved “drop_columns” + glob-matching; TEVIMBRA traffic/downloads/pages loaders now functioning; new multi-brand workspace bootstrap tool; updated .env structure for brand routing.

Tools/Skills: DuckDB, pandas ETL, Excel header normalization, YAML-driven config, environment-variable routing, CLI tooling, repo restructuring, debugging multi-row header formats, defensive data loading.

Open/Next: Finalize device loader flexibility for TEVIMBRA; add automated schema validation CLI for new raw files; expand test coverage for brand-specific loaders; produce a raw-data formatting guide; optionally add generalized header inference across loaders to reduce per-brand YAML tuning.

Project: WebReportingHub (multi-brand DuckDB/analytics + Quarto reporting toolkit)
Goal: Stabilize analysis outputs and reporting templates; add documentation and housekeeping; resolve visualization and loader quirks.
Key tasks/decisions:
Added a comprehensive product overview doc (docs/PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md) outlining capabilities, architecture, operations, roadmap, risks, and contacts.
Logged and closed a legend-ordering bug; adjusted stacked chart legends across device, source, contact, video modules.
Fixed trailing-period chart titles to reflect actual quarters in traffic, device, source, downloads, engagement, contact, and video analyses.
Repositioned legends for all line charts to the side to avoid obscuring data.
Made traffic loader tolerant of missing audiences (e.g., HCP-only files).
Diagnosed bad dates in patch_downloads.xlsx (extra table with old dates) and advised cleanup.
Created executive summaries and discussion prompts for multiple brand bundles (Brukinsa, TEVIMBRA) and flagged AI/AEO considerations.
Logged issue for legend mismatch and updated the issue log when resolved.
Guidance on Git hygiene: tagging, branching, pushing tags.
Outcomes/deliverables:
New doc: docs/PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md.
Code fixes: src/analysis/traffic.py, device.py, source.py, downloads.py, engagement.py, contact.py, video.py, utils.py (trailing labels, legend positioning), traffic loader flexibility.
Issue tracking: docs/issues/2025-10-29--legend-sequence-mismatch.md closed; Issue_Log.md updated.
Skills/tech/tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), DuckDB ETL, Quarto/Beamer reporting, YAML configs, git tagging/branching, issue management.
Open issues/next steps:
Regenerate charts to visually confirm legend placement/order in fresh bundles.
Outstanding backlog items per Issue_Log (post-load reconciliation, PPT builder, pytest coverage, warehouse docs).
Optionally push tags/branches to remote if collaborating.

romo Fingerprint Visualizer

Goals: Understand existing workspace and hydrate on the “Pharma Promotional Ecosystem ‘Fingerprint’ System — Build Spec” to plan a program that lets users create/save ecosystem visualizations.
Key tasks/decisions: Located and reviewed the external build spec (../cxDashboard/...Build Spec.md); surveyed current repo contents (R + Quarto scaffold, DuckDB schema helpers, init scripts, demo funnel report); noted available channel inventory CSV for taxonomy.
Outcomes/deliverables: No code changes; captured spec highlights (taxonomy-driven ingest/normalize/visualize pipeline, CLI expectations, acceptance criteria) and current state (DB schema, Quarto preview).
Skills/tech/tools: Repo/file discovery (ls, find), reading Markdown specs and R/Quarto files, contextual synthesis of data/visualization requirements.
Open issues/next steps: Scaffold project per spec; implement ingest/transform/normalize + plotting modules with tests; wire CLI and Quarto report; derive canonical channel config from hcp_channel_inventory_list.csv.

roject: CX Ecosystem Sunburst Builder (Streamlit, local-only).

Goal: Let users select HCP channels, apply presets, weight tactics, and export sunburst charts (PNG/SVG) fully offline.
Key tasks/decisions: Switched inventory source to CSV only (data/raw/hcp_channel_inventory.csv, presets in extra columns); added per-channel weights; replaced jittery st.data_editor with manual checkbox/weight inputs plus sync flag to align presets/imports; reordered viz tabs (Selected first, Full second); moved export button above charts and right-aligned beside “Channel visualization” header; full chart greys unselected slices.
Outcomes: Updated data loader (src/cx_ecosystem/data.py) to read CSV + presets; UI logic (src/cx_ecosystem/app.py) for manual grid, weights, preset catalog, export placement; visualization colors (src/cx_ecosystem/visualizations.py) with complementary PP/NPP scheme, category inheritance, active/inactive rendering, black center; README reflects CSV/preset workflow.
Skills/tools: Streamlit UI/state management, pandas CSV ingest, Plotly sunburst styling, HSL color tuning, layout adjustments, export handling.
Open issues/next steps: Outer ring still not vibrant enough—retune channel saturation/brightness (engagement darkest, categories medium, channels “brightest”); ensure presets always apply to grid; reduce console widget label warnings; optionally tighten grid row height further.

Project: ThroughLine UI/UX polish and task-flow fixes.

Goals/intent: Align UI across modes, improve dialogs (quick task, help/bug), fix task sorting/timeline sync, and keep dark theme consistent.

Key tasks/decisions:

Updated quick task dialog (label “New Task”, calendar picker, edit icon placement), persisted defaults, and aligned button styling with “New Task”.
Revised header layouts: filters/search repositioned in task mode; consistent mode toggle styling; dark theme reinforced across pages.
Rebuilt hierarchy layout into three flex panes with padding and spacing adjustments; ensured backgrounds stay navy/black and added JS/CSS to prevent white flashes.
Added close “X” controls across dialogs/overlays and fixed hover overlay toggle state.
Tweaked bug-report dialog copy and removed redundant contact field.
Adjusted task kanban sorting (by urgency then recency; closed by completion date) and removed due-date color bar on closed tasks; timeline view now hides closed items promptly.
Help overview rewritten for non-technical users; README reviewed/updated.
Outcomes/deliverables: Major edits in src/throughline/gui/nicegui/app.py; refreshed src/throughline/help_overview.md (layperson-focused); README touched for accuracy.

Skills/tech/tools: NiceGUI/Python UI composition, custom CSS/JS injection for theming, layout refactor with flex, dialog UX patterns, task sorting logic.

Open issues/next steps: Mode toggle styling still inconsistent per user feedback (active/inactive visibility); needs final pass to ensure all four buttons have uniform, high-contrast states across modes. Visual verification recommended.
