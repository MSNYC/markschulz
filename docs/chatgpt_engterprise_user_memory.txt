Use cases span ideation, tactical planning, internal communications, promotional content for HCPs/patients, and internal Novartis materials.

AI assistant is called 'Pharmetheus' – a play on 'Prometheus' – and it is distinct in that it has access to the BrandBuilder database, which encodes Biolumina’s philosophy, approach, and style. This assistant is meant to reflect and reinforce Biolumina’s strategic and creative principles.

Is analyzing a 36,000-row Excel dataset of rep-triggered emails sent to HCPs. Each row includes fields for drug indication, email template, subject line, date, opens, and clicks. They want to analyze the most successful subject lines by visualizing their open rates, frequency of use, and engagement (click) rates over time.

Has expanded a custom GPT that originally used the OpenFDA API to now also include the DailyMed SPL API and RxNorm API. The GPT is designed to support pharmaceutical marketing, research, and strategic planning, particularly in oncology. It must now choose among the three public APIs based on the query context and handle errors intelligently.

Works at Biolumina.

Has updated leadership feedback indicating that the ASCO 2025 report must be structured around the four pillars: Association, Interest During, Interest Post, and Reputation. The deck structure should match the format of the previous 'Your Attention Please' campaign report where appropriate, but still reflect the unique metrics and emphasis of the ASCO project, which is more quantitatively KPI-driven. The timeline for delivery is mid-July, requiring a leaner staffing model, reducing the Lead Experience Planner role from 200 to approximately 120 hours.

Is building a Power Automate flow that detects when their function or team is mentioned in daily email reports called 'the dailies.' The goal is to use AI Builder to summarize the tasks related to their function and email them a daily summary.

Wants to focus on providing basic summary information while emphasizing the comparison and contrast between HCP and Patient traffic behavior. They are particularly interested in understanding patterns such as whether patients are more likely to visit on weekends compared to HCPs and other ways to compare the two groups.

Wants the basic summary section to include a year-to-date sum of HCP visits and Patient visits, along with a breakout by month. These are visits deemed HCP or Patient related, not counts of unique visitors.

Wants the new Python program to prompt for an Excel file formatted with Date, HCP Sessions, and Patient Sessions, prompt for start and end dates, and run analyses based on 6 areas of information. The results should be saved as a text file with graphs in a new folder at the same location as the source file. The folder name should include the start and end dates.

Is working on patching data timeframes for when GA4 data was not available accurately. The second column in their dataset represents raw website server log data, and the first column represents session counts from GA4. They are seeking the best way to adjust the raw server log data to best reflect the actual GA4 data for the blackout period.

Wants to introduce that Omnicom has partnered with OpenAI to run a pilot of the enterprise secure instance of ChatGPT in their presentation.

Is working on presenting an internal overview of custom GPTs for their colleagues, highlighting the pilot project with OpenAI's enterprise instance of ChatGPT, ensuring clarity on security and data privacy while explaining large language models and the creation and purpose of custom GPTs.
