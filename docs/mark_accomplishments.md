## 1. AI Innovation & Enterprise Enablement
- Led creation, testing, and deployment of multiple custom GPTs for Biolumina and oncology-focused brands.
- Developed GPTs using JSON knowledge bases, structured prompt engineering, and API integrations (OpenFDA, DailyMed SPL, RxNorm).
- Created internal education materials explaining AI, ML, LLMs, and enterprise privacy/security principles.
- Helped guide Omnicom’s enterprise ChatGPT pilot by evaluating workflows, summarizing feedback, and developing internal-facing documentation.
- Built a multi-chapter ChatGPT orientation video series (“Byte by Bite”) to improve AI literacy across the agency.
- Explored workflows for integrating GPT with DAM systems to analyze visual themes in assets.
- Created an AI ideation GPT using AIDA, PAS, FOMO, SCAMPER, FAB, StoryBrand, and more.
- Assisted in developing AI use case spreadsheets spanning tactical planning, internal communications, HCP/patient content, and operational automation.

## 2. Strategy & Oncology Marketing Expertise
- Built a GPT specializing in oncology HCP customer journeys using JSON-trained data.
- Developed methodology for evaluating HCP influencers within pharma marketing.
- Supported client brand initiatives by designing omnichannel, segmentation, CTV/OTT, and experiential congress frameworks.
- Designed interactive game-based advertising concepts and WebAR strategies with 8th Wall.
- Contributed to naming and ideation for oncology-branded GPT assistants (e.g., “Oracle” concepts and long-U sounds).

## 3. Data Engineering & Analytics Leadership
- Created advanced Google Analytics workflows including:
  - Regression-based reconstruction of corrupted GA4 session data using server logs.
  - Analysis of session segmentation (HCP vs Patient), including weekend behavior.
  - Quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comparative models.
  - Advanced bounce rate and session duration monitoring.
  - Session-per-user anomaly detection.
- Developed a Python program that ingests Excel files, requests date ranges, computes analyses, and outputs reports with graphs.
- Explored R-based data storage solutions for long‑term GA4 datasets.
- Built Power Query pipelines for data transformation.
- Analyzed 36,000-row rep-triggered email dataset to understand subject-line performance.

## 4. Automation & Workflow Optimization
- Designed VBA tools to batch-export PPT slides to PNG for OCR processing.
- Built Python + BeautifulSoup website crawlers with URL-structured extraction and repeated-section de‑duplication.
- Created processes for converting heavy PDFs, PPTs, and Word files into lighter JSON/XML structures.
- Supported SharePoint List exploration as a relational database alternative for message management.
- Designed Power Automate flows using AI Builder to detect daily mentions and trigger summaries.

## 5. Creative & Concept Development
- Developed program names riffing on “Choose Your Own Adventure” in clinically relevant ways.
- Built frameworks for ranking questions, user insights, and segmentation.
- Produced ideation materials guiding creative teams using structured models.
- Refined brand initiative naming and design (Curiosity-Driven Innovation Initiative).

## 6. Presentation, Communication, & Education
- Created internal decks explaining LLMs, GPTs, security, and enterprise capabilities.
- Prepared presentations for Omnicom leadership on AI pilot programs.
- Developed ASCO 2025 reporting frameworks aligned to four pillars (Association, Interest During, Interest Post, Reputation).
- Created guidance for AI-driven tactical planning cycles.
- Produced shareable documentation on structuring knowledge bases for custom GPTs.

## 7. Technical Problem-Solving & Tool Development
- Provided cross-platform expertise (Mac, Office 365, Adobe Acrobat Pro, Python, R, VBA).
- Solved debugging challenges in Python (length mismatch errors, library conflicts).
- Ensured secure environments by avoiding Homebrew and managing MacPorts limitations.
- Evaluated Figma API and Mermaid.js workflows for visualization.

## 8. Leadership, Collaboration & Innovation Culture
- Led or contributed to AI initiatives under the BEACON task force.
- Helped shape Biolumina’s AI strategy by documenting use cases and reviewing enterprise tools (OmniAI, CoPilot, Firefly, HeyGen, internal TTS).
- Developed curriculum for agency-wide AI learning (“Byte by Bite”).
- Created onboarding, support, and ideation tools for creative & strategy teams.
- Served as an internal subject matter expert across GA4, AI, analytics, automation, and oncology customer journeys.
