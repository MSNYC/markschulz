# Mark Schulz - Professional Portfolio

Interactive portfolio and resume website for pharmaceutical marketing professional Mark Schulz.

**Live Site:** [markschulz.me](https://markschulz.me)

## About This Project

This is a single-page portfolio website featuring an interactive resume builder that allows visitors to filter my 20+ year career by role type or create custom views based on specific focus areas.

Rather than reading a traditional one-size-fits-all resume, recruiters and hiring managers can:

- **Select pre-built profiles**: Brand Management, Strategic Planning, or Customer Experience & Omnichannel Innovation
- **Create custom views**: Choose 1-3 focus areas (therapeutic areas, audiences, technical skills) that match their open position
- **See relevant experience first**: The tool surfaces the most applicable achievements and projects based on the selected criteria

## Features

- **Interactive Resume Filtering**: JavaScript-powered dynamic content filtering
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Privacy-Focused**: No tracking or analytics
- **Professional Assessment Integration**: Incorporates insights from Myers-Briggs (ENTJ) and FIRO-B assessments

## Technology

Built with Jekyll (static site generator) and hosted on GitHub Pages. Uses vanilla JavaScript for interactivity - no frameworks or build tools required.

The interactive resume data is stored in JSON format and filtered client-side for fast, responsive performance.

## Design Philosophy

This site demonstrates my approach to problem-solving:

1. **User-centered**: Designed from the recruiter's perspective - what do they need to know?
2. **Efficient**: Reduces the time needed to assess candidate fit
3. **Transparent**: Shows my working style and professional assessment results openly
4. **Modern**: Uses contemporary web technologies while maintaining simplicity
